        <h2>2A: Simple SVG stuff</h2>
        <p>
           In this exercise are we going to put something simple on the web. 
           We will start with adding five squares with different colors and positions.
           The result can be seen below.
        </p>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="a.js"></script>
        <svg width="500" height="100" stroke="gray" stroke-width="2">
            <rect x="0" y="20" width="80" height="80" fill="rgba(128, 0, 128, 1.0)" />
            <rect x="20" y="15" width="80" height="80" fill="rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.75)" />
            <rect x="40" y="10" width="80" height="80" fill="rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.5)" />
            <rect x="60" y="5" width="80" height="80" fill="rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.25)" />
            <rect x="80" y="0" width="80" height="80" fill="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)" />

        <h2>2B: One scatter plot and two datasets</h2>
        <p>
            In this exercise you will see how the crime has evolved from 2003 to 2015 in San Francisco by way of this interactive scatterplot.
            The labels are the police districts in San Francisco.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Use the switch to toggle data between 2003 and 2015</b> - the size of the circles represent the total amount of crimes in a PdDistric relative to eachother.
        </p>
        <div class="onoffswitch">
            <input type="checkbox" name="onoffswitch" class="onoffswitch-checkbox" id="toggleDate" checked>
            <label class="onoffswitch-label" for="toggleDate">
                <span class="onoffswitch-inner"></span>
                <span class="onoffswitch-switch"></span>
            </label>
        </div>
        <div id="bVis"></div>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="b.js"></script>
        <h3>Static axis</h3>
        <p>
            Because the idea of the plot is to compare crime data between 2003 and 2015, it is important that the axis act as a point of reference.
            If the scale of the axis would change according to each dataset then it would be confusing to the viewer what message the plots are conveying,
            since we mostly rely on our ability to understand geometry to analyze our surroundings.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="c">
        <h2>2C: One barchart and (at least) two datasets</h2>
        <p>
            We will in this exercise look into the recorded crimes for each year from 2010 to 2015. 
            We will do this by visualizing the recorded crimes in their respective category.
            Each of the bars are thus a category from the data set.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Use the blue arrows to switch between the views for each year</b> - The height of the bar chart represents the number of crimes.
        </p>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="c.js"></script>
        <p class="fun">FUN FACT. The total amount of crimes for both 2013 and 2015 is the exact same. Weird!</p>

        <h2>2D: Visualizing geodata</h2>
        <p>
            For this exercise we made a map. The map is of San Francisco's police districts.
            Overlayed on the map are recorded cases of prostitution classified belonging different clusters using the k-means clustering algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Use the buttons to switch the number of clusters</b> - the color of the circles represent the cluster it belongs to. 
            The nearest black circle is the centroid of the cluster.
        </p>

        <script type="text/javascript" src="d.js"></script>
        <button type="button" onclick="updateKmeans(5)">Click to k = 6</button>
        <button type="button" onclick="updateKmeans(5)">Click to k = 5</button>
        <button type="button" onclick="updateKmeans(4)">Click to k = 4</button>
        <button type="button" onclick="updateKmeans(3)">Click to k = 3</button>
        <button type="button" onclick="updateKmeans(2)">Click to k = 2</button>
